# Custom Report Builder
REDCap module that allows you to create HTML templates and fill them with record data from your project. You can download the filled templates as a PDF.

This module works for classic, longitudinal, and multiple arm projects, but has not been tested with repeatable events.

## Configuration

### System Configurations
- Saved Templates Folder: Required configuration that defines the storage location of all created templates. 
- Compiled Templates Folder: Required configuration that defines the storage of compiled templates generated by the PHP template engine Smarty.
- Images Folder: Required configuration that defines the publically accessible storage of images uploaded by users. 

## Project Configurations
- Save Filled Templates to File Repository: This is specific to downloading a filled template, and will save a copy of the PDF to the File Repository. 

## Permissions

Users must have data export access in order to use the module, and perhaps additional permissions, listed below, to use certain features. 

## Creating/Editing a Template

Users must have access to data exports and reports in order to edit or create a template. The content will be created in the WYSIWYG CKEditor, and saved as an HTML file in the previously configured saved templates folder. In order to pass template validation, the syntax instruction must be followed. Invalid templates will be saved under "{template name}_{project id} - INVALID.html" and can be edited but not filled, and errors will be returned to the user. Valid templates will be saved, and the user will be redirected to the module index.

Users may add optional footers and headers that follow the same syntax rules as the body.

Users may upload and browse images. However, no security is placed on what images are uploaded, and all images uploaded to the project are viewable by every user. Consider this before uploading.

The user may copy-paste pre-formatted fields and events into their template. Descriptive text fields are exempt from the list. 

## Deleting a template

Users must have access to data exports and reports in order to delete a template. 

## Filling and Downloading Template

The module users the PHP template engine, Smarty, to fill in the templates with the apprpriate record data. Smarty will compile the template and store it in the previously configured compiled templates folder. The user is free to make edits to the template content before downloading. When the template is downloaded, if saving templates to the file repository has been configured, then the module will do so.
